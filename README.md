## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project requires **Python 3** and **Jupyter Notebook** the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Pickle] pickle module is already available with python 3.6 and 3.7
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/times/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this Project we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, we will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform here.

This project is divided into the following tasks

I. Exploratory Data Analysis
Before making recommendations of any kind, we will need to explore the data you are working with for the project. Dive in to see what you can find.

II. Rank Based Recommendations
Finding the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions.

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, we could look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users.

IV. Matrix Factorization
Finally, we will complete a machine learning approach to building recommendations. Using the user-item interactions, we will build out a matrix decomposition. Using our decomposition, we will get an idea of how well you can predict new articles an individual might interact with (spoiler alert - it isn't great).
